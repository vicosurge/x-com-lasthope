        <h3>The Vision</h3>
        <p>
          Last Hope was born from a simple but ambitious idea: what if you could experience
          the tactical alien defense gameplay of X-COM from a first-person perspective?
          Using Valve's Half-Life engine, the team set out to create a modification that
          would capture the spirit and atmosphere of the X-COM universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mod aimed to recreate the tension and tactical depth of X-COM missions,
          where every corner could hide an alien threat and every shot could mean the
          difference between mission success and catastrophic failure.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
        <p>
          <strong style="color: var(--accent-orange);">June 14, 2002:</strong> The Last Hope forums launched at lasthopemod.com.
          Founding members Salvi (Project Lead), ApOcaLyPSe_1985 (Lead Modeller), and Psyguy (Forum Moderator)
          registered on this day, marking the official start of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Summer 2002:</strong> The community grew rapidly. By August, forums had 45+ topics and 500+ posts
          in General Discussion alone. Contributors like Cyalume, Futant, XPlicit, and Nod joined the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>November 2002:</strong> Salvi completed the website backend. The community celebrated watching
          the site update "right before their eyes."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2002-2003:</strong> Active development continued with weapon models, maps, and assets.
          Pendra37 asked about alpha/beta release dates. The forum grew to 50+ registered members.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2004-2006:</strong> Development slowed. By late 2004, the domain was briefly parked before
          eventually transitioning to a new team and a new project - the Crysis-era Last Hope.

        <h3>X-COM Heritage</h3>
        <p>
          X-COM: UFO Defense (also known as UFO: Enemy Unknown) captivated players worldwide
          with its blend of strategic base management and tactical turn-based combat. The
          series became a cult classic, inspiring countless fans and game developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last Hope drew from this rich heritage, incorporating:
        </p>
        <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          <li>X-COM styled weapon designs and equipment</li>
          <li>The tense atmosphere of alien encounters</li>
          <li>Mission-based gameplay scenarios</li>
          <li>The iconic visual style of X-COM environments</li>
          <li>The soldier vs. alien combat dynamic</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Development Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Development was community-driven from the start. The phpBB 2.0 forums at lasthopemod.com/dboard/
          served as the central hub where contributors could share their work, receive feedback,
          and collaborate with other modders. Using the classic subSilver theme, the forums
          provided a familiar environment for the modding community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The community was truly international - members from the USA, Netherlands, UK, Canada,
          Hungary, Russia, Australia, Egypt, and beyond came together united by their love of X-COM.
          Conversations ranged from technical modelling discussions to holiday greetings posted
          in multiple languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website featured dedicated sections for showcasing different types of content:
        </p>
        <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          <li><strong>Models:</strong> Character and object models (Nod from Russia was particularly prolific)</li>
          <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Custom weapon models based on X-COM arsenal (ApOcaLyPSe_1985's specialty)</li>
          <li><strong>Items:</strong> Equipment and pickup items</li>
          <li><strong>In-Game:</strong> Screenshots showing actual gameplay and maps (XPlicit's Farm map, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Technical Foundation</h3>
        <p>
          Built on the GoldSrc engine (Half-Life 1), Last Hope leveraged the mature modding
          ecosystem that had grown around Valve's flagship shooter. This gave the team access
          to established tools and a wealth of community knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original website used server-side includes (.shtml files) and was styled with
          the dark color scheme that became iconic to the project - featuring the distinctive
          orange (#DD8300) accent color that we've preserved in this memorial.
